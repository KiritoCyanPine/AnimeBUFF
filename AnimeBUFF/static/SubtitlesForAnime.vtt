<v Main Mahito>Oh, there you are!

3
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:28.380
<v Main Mahito>Jougo!

4
00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.040
<v Main Mahito>Looks like most of your body's back.

5
00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.610
<v Main Jougo>Yeah, this place is relaxing.

6
00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.880
<v Main Jougo>Humans don't come anywhere near it.

7
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.930
<v Main Mahito>Lacking a body really is a problem.

8
00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.790
<v Main Mahito>It makes self-preservation so inefficient.

9
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.330
<v Main Jougo>Mahito, you're awfully worn down yourself.

10
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.150
<v Main Mahito>Oh, you could tell?

11
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.960
<v Main Mahito>Sukuna and his vessel 
are my natural enemies.

12
00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.970
<v Main Mahito>I started this game because 
I happened to acquire a new toy,

13
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.890
<v Main Mahito>but it just didn't go so well.

14
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.460
<v Main Mahito>It was great at first, though.

15
00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.470
<v Main Mahito>Are you sure I shouldn't have just 
used a hostage to force him into a pact?

16
00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:17.100
<v Main Mahito>Like, "Hand your body over to Sukuna 
if you don't want to see him killed."

17
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.280
<v Main Getou>No, pacts are only placed 
by oneself on oneself.

18
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.500
<v Main Getou>It's not easy to forge pacts with others, 
or due to intervention from others.

19
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.770
<v Italics Mahito>Maybe I should have just given that thing 
a lethal wound instead of transfiguring it.

20
00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.650
<v Italics Mahito>Then Sukuna might have been able to heal 
it with his reverse cursed technique.

21
00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.000
<v Flashback Sukuna>Know your place, fool.

22
00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.540
<v Italics Mahito>No, not with that personality.

23
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.810
<v Italics Mahito>I think he would have refused either way.

24
00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.380
<v Main Mahito>Jougo...

25
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.200
<v Main Mahito>Touching Sukuna made me realize that

26
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.380
<v Main Mahito>we should probably proceed 
with Getou's plan for now.

27
00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.460
<v Main Mahito>Sukuna is that valuable.

28
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.820
<v Main Jougo>Gather all the fingers and 
offer them to Sukuna, huh?

29
00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.980
<v Main Jougo>Even if we're all wiped out in the process, eh?

30
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.480
<v Main Jougo>Very well.

31
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.660
<v Main Jougo>I don't need to be the one laughing 
in the wasteland a century from now.

32
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.960
<v Main Jougo>As long as curses stand there as 
people, that's all that matters.

33
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.460
<v Main Mahito>Oh, you get it!

34
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.000
<v Main Getou>Then first, let's go retrieve the 
six fingers Jujutsu Tech has.

35
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.420
<v Main Jougo>Is that necessary?

36
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.640
<v Main Jougo>The sorcerers are only 
keeping Itadori Yuuji around

37
00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:40.590
<v Main Jougo>so he can take in Sukuna's fingers, right?

38
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.720
<v Main Jougo>He'll still eat them, even if we leave them be.

39
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.610
<v Main Getou>The higher-ups at Jujutsu Tech

40
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.300
<v Main Getou>are struggling to measure 
Itadori Yuuji's strength as a vessel,

41
00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.710
<v Main Getou>to see how many he can take 
before he goes berserk.

42
00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.480
<v Main Getou>They won't let him take them in 
until they've gathered all the fingers...

43
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.500
<v Main Getou>With just one exception.

<v Main Getou>And we can't wait that long, right?

47
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.390
<v Main Getou>Worst case, there's also a chance 
they'll eliminate Itadori Yuuji.

48
00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.500
<v Main Jougo>Into the tiger's den, huh?

49
00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.180
<v Main Jougo>Well, what should we do, then?

50
00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.000
<v Main Getou>I've already taken steps.

51
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.890

68

that finger in Yoshino'sâ€”

69
00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:53.380
<v Main Nanami>I haven't told him.

70
00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:57.220

71

<v Main Gojou>I'm glad I left you in charge.

72
00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:01.540
<v Main Gojou>And the finger?

73
00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.450
<v Main Nanami>I submitted it to the higher-ups, of course.

74
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:08.990
<v Main Nanami>If I gave it to you, you'd just 
feed it to Itadori-kun, right?

75
00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:09.750
<v Main Gojou>Tsk.

76
00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:13.530

77
00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.930

255
00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:33.330

<v Main Fushiguro>He limits his vocabulary to keep others safe.

257
00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.220
<v Main Yuuji>So if he told someone to 
go die, they'd actually die?

258
00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:40.580
<v Main Yuuji>That's really powerful.

260
00:13:43.010 --> 00:13:46.120

he's hit with massive feedback.

282
00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:53.090

<v Main Gakuganji>I've heard that Itadori's 
previous death was suicide.

307
00:15:56.130 --> 00:16:00.840
<v Main Gakuganji>What is the one thing you must be cautious 
about when ending a hostile sorcerer?

308
00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.840
<v Main Gakuganji>Kamo.

309
00:16:02.130 --> 00:16:02.940
<v Main Kamo>Yes.

310
00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:06.240
<v Main Kamo>You must kill them with cursed 
energy to prevent them from

311
00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.950
<v Main Kamo>coming back as a curse after death.

312
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:09.450
<v Main Gakuganji>Exactly.

313
00:16:09.450 --> 00:16:14.020
<v Main Gakuganji>If another delivers the finishing blow 
with cursed energy, then all is well.

314
00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:17.950
<v Main Gakuganji>At present, Itadori Yuuji 
has control of the body.

315
00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:21.420
<v Main Gakuganji>Unless Sukuna comes out, 
he's just a first-year.

316
00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:22.750
<v Main Gakuganji>Killing him will beâ€”

317
00:16:24.390 --> 00:16:26.620
<v Main Toudou>This is stupid. Do what you want.

318
00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.090
<v Main Kamo>Come back, Toudou.

319
00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:31.090
<v Main Kamo>The principal isn't finished yet.

320
00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:36.010
<v Main Toudou>Takada-chan's making a guest 
appearance on a walking show at 11.

321
00:16:36.010 --> 00:16:38.100
<v Main Toudou>Do I need to explain any more?

322
00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.600
<v Main Kamo>You can record it. Come back here.

323
00:16:40.850 --> 00:16:44.200
<v Main Toudou>I'm going to watch the recording 
<i>and</i> watch it in real time!

324
00:16:44.670 --> 00:16:46.360
<v Main Toudou>Who do you take me for?

325
00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:49.980
<v Main Mai><i>That's</i> your problem here?!

326
00:16:49.980 --> 00:16:51.600
<v Main Toudou>Listen, all of you.

327
00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:53.650
<v Main Toudou>You listen, too, old man.

328
00:16:53.880 --> 00:16:58.660
<v Main Toudou>I've long been disappointed in you all 
and your bad taste in women.

329
00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:01.340
<v Main Toudou>Plot and scheme all you want on your own.

330
00:17:01.660 --> 00:17:04.660
<v Main Toudou>But if you try to order me around again,

331
00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:06.680
<v Main Toudou>I'll kill you.

332
00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:12.380
<v Main Miwa>What do we do now?

333
00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:16.380
<v Main Miwa>I don't think we'll be able to carry 
out the plan with him like that.

334
00:17:16.650 --> 00:17:18.810
<v Main Miwa>The principal's gone off somewhere, too.

335
00:17:18.810 --> 00:17:21.860
<v Main Miwa>I don't want to be killed by that guy.

336
00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:23.890
<v Main Momo>Does it even matter?

337
00:17:24.090 --> 00:17:27.790
<v Main Momo>He's going to go straight 
for the Tokyo team, anyway.

338
00:17:27.790 --> 00:17:29.920
<v Main Momo>If he's just going to go berserk,

339
00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:32.810
<v Main Momo>we can focus on the game.

340
00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:36.790
<v Main Mai>But we have to kill Itadori Yuuji, right?

341
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.480
<v Italics Miwa>We're seriously doing this?

342
00:17:38.920 --> 00:17:42.460
<v Main Mai>I don't think he'll go as far as killing him.

343
00:17:42.460 --> 00:17:44.250
<v Main Mai>Though he probably could.

344
00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.050
<v Main Mechamaru>Then we'll need someone to 
keep an eye on Toudou

345
00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:50.480
<v Main Mechamaru>and deliver the final blow to Itadori Yuuji.

346
00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.410
<v Italics Miwa>I don't like this.

347
00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:56.380
<v Main Miwa>We'll have cursed spirits to deal with, too, 
so we'll be in two-man cells anyway.

348
00:17:56.380 --> 00:17:58.000
<v Main Miwa>That works out for us.

349
00:17:58.450 --> 00:17:59.230
<v Main Kamo>No.

350
00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:02.740
<v Main Kamo>Allowing a half-wit like Itadori Yuuji

351
00:18:02.740 --> 00:18:06.370
<v Main Kamo>to be a sorcerer at Jujutsu Tech 
is a serious problem.

352
00:18:06.740 --> 00:18:08.770
<v Main Kamo>One that goes beyond this exchange event.

353
00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:11.820
<v Main Kamo>I cannot overlook this as the 
eldest son of the Kamo clan.

354
00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:16.820
<v Main Kamo>We're all attacking Itadori Yuuji together.

355
00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:18.660
<v Main Momo>Hold on.

356
00:18:18.910 --> 00:18:22.620
<v Main Momo>What happens if Inumaki-kun 
is with Itadori-kun?

357
00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:27.510
<v Main Momo>Having all of us in one place is a risky 
move with that cursed speech user.

358
00:18:27.510 --> 00:18:30.600
<v Main Momo>Worst case, he could 
wipe us all out at once.

359
00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:33.100
<v Main Mechamaru>That's true.

360
00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:38.140
<v Main Kamo>No, if you know he's coming, 
he's not that scary to face.

361
00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:40.560
<v Main Mai>Let me have Maki.

362
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.640
<v Main Mai>That brown-haired first-year, too, if possible.

363
00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:46.080
<v Main Kamo>You're sounding just like Toudou.

364
00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:51.520
<v Main Utahime>So what did you want?

365
00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:53.950
<v Main Gojou>Huh? Why are you mad?

366
00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:56.440
<v Main Utahime>I'm not mad, actually.

367
00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:59.630
<v Main Gojou>Right? I haven't done anything, after all.

368
00:19:01.150 --> 00:19:06.320
<v Main Gojou>There's someone working with either 
a curse user or curses at Jujutsu Tech.

369
00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:08.910
<v Main Utahime>Impossible!

370
00:19:08.910 --> 00:19:11.310
<v Main Utahime>A curse user might be one thing, 
but working with curses?

371
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:14.880
<v Main Gojou>A lot of them on that level 
have been popping up lately.

372
00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:19.380
<v Main Gojou>They understand human speech, and they've 
formed a faction that's operating with purpose.

373
00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:22.890
<v Main Gojou>They might think they're just 
working with a curse user, but...

374
00:19:23.930 --> 00:19:27.340
<v Main Gojou>I'd like to ask you to handle 
investigating those at Kyoto, Utahime.

375
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.360
<v Main Utahime>What would you do if I was the traitor?

376
00:19:31.610 --> 00:19:32.920
<v Main Gojou>No way.

377
00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:35.480
<v Main Gojou>You're weak, and you don't have the gutsâ€”

378
00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:40.630
<v Main Gojou>Scary! Hysterics won't win men, you know.

379
00:19:40.630 --> 00:19:43.450
<v Main Utahime>I! Am! The senior here!

380
00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:49.020
<v Main Fushiguro>Itadori.

381
00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:51.480
<v Main Fushiguro>You okay?

382
00:19:51.740 --> 00:19:55.260
<v Main Yuuji>Yeah, sounds like I've got 
a big role, but I'll manage.

383
00:19:55.260 --> 00:19:56.380
<v Main Fushiguro>I'm not talking about that.

384
00:19:56.860 --> 00:19:58.300
<v Main Fushiguro>Something happened, right?

385
00:19:58.530 --> 00:20:00.300
<v Main Yuuji>Huh? Nothing happened.

386
00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:04.800
<v Main Yuuji>Okay, it did.

387
00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:09.320
<v Main Yuuji>But it's true that I'm fine.

388
00:20:10.590 --> 00:20:14.350
<v Main Yuuji>In fact, because of what happened, 
I don't want to lose to anyone.

389
00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:16.780
<v Main Fushiguro>Okay, then.

390
00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:20.200
<v Main Fushiguro>I don't really want to lose, either.

391
00:20:20.470 --> 00:20:21.980
<v Main Kugisaki>What do you mean, "really"?

392
00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:24.190
<v Main Kugisaki>You already got sent rolling around once!

393
00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:26.870
<v Main Kugisaki>Overwhelm them! 
Let's thoroughly trounce them!

394
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:28.170
<v Main Kugisaki>For Maki-san's sake, too!

395
00:20:28.170 --> 00:20:29.860
<v Main Maki>Don't say stuff like that.

396
00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:30.980
<v Main Toge>Pollack roe.

397
00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:33.130
<v Main Panda>Yeah! For Maki-san's sake, too!

398
00:20:33.130 --> 00:20:35.130
<v Main Maki>Don't say stuff like that.

399
00:20:37.280 --> 00:20:38.790
<v Main Yuuji>Well, in that case,

400
00:20:39.490 --> 00:20:40.690
<v Main Yuuji>let's win!

401
00:20:42.230 --> 00:20:43.990
<v Main Maki>What are you doing taking the lead?

402
00:20:43.990 --> 00:20:45.010

406
00:22:26.930 --> 00:22:29.330

414
00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.480
<v Main Blue Suit>How long have you been making sushi, boss?

415
00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:06.780
<v Main Boss>I've been doing it since I was 20.

416
00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:11.260
<v Main Takada>Which means... about 300 years?

417
00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:12.870
<v Main Blue Suit>Are you drunk?

418
00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.870
<v Main Boss>Here's the goatfish you ordered.

419
00:23:19.610 --> 00:23:21.900
<v Main Takada>Mm, it's so good!

420
00:23:21.900 --> 00:23:23.970
<v Main Takada>Can I have yours, too?

421
00:23:23.970 --> 00:23:25.380
