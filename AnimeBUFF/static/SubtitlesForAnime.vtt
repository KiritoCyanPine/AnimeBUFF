00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:42.900
<v Default Subaru>Aren't you, um...

2
00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.370
<v Default Subaru>a bit close, Petra?

3
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.320
<v Default Petra>Well, she had you all to herself earlier.

4
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.900
<v Default Petra>It wasn't fair!

5
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:50.740
<v Default Petra>You don't mind, right?

6
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.870
<v Default Emilia>Um... It's not like that, Petra-chan.

7
00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.390
<v Default Emilia>Subaru and I were just...

8
00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.780
<v Default Emilia>Right! We had important things to talk about!

9
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.700
<v Default Petra>I'm not gonna lose to you! You hear me?!

10
00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.190
<v Default Subaru>Emilia-tan, she's only a kid.

11
00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.090
<v Default Subaru>You just have to smile and 
laugh off what kids say.

12
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.080
<v Default Emilia>No way.

13
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.570
<v Default Emilia>Even if she's a child,

14
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.120
<v Default Emilia>I can't take such a lackadaisical attitude.

15
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.720
<v Default Subaru>Lackadaisical? Who says 
that in this day and age?

16
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.850
<v Default Emilia>You're teasing me again!

17
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.310
<v Default Petra>I'm not a kid!

18
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.800
<v Default Subaru>Okay, sorry.

19
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.360
<v Default Subaru>I need to thank you, Petra.

20
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.110
<v Default Subaru>You kept your promise to not 
leave Emilia-tan alone.

21
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.990
<v Default Subaru>There are so many people I need 
to thank when things calm down.

22
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.540
<v Default Subaru>I'm really grateful to Crusch-san and her gang,

23
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.830
<v Default Subaru>and Anastasia-san and her 
people helped a lot, too.

24
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:49.880
<v Default Subaru>And I hate to admit it,

25
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.960
<v Default Subaru>but the same goes for Julius and those guys.

26
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.180
<v Default Subaru>I'm even indebted to Otto.

27
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.040
<v Default Otto>Did you say something, Natsuki-san?

28
00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.230
<v Default Subaru>Nah, nothing.

29
00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.140
<v Default Subaru>Just that I'm super grateful to you, too!

30
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.260
<v Default Otto>Gosh, what brought that on?

31
00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:08.750
<v Default Otto>You're making me blush.

32
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:09.480
<v Default Subaru>And...

33
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.190
<v Default Emilia>What's wrong, Subaru?

34
00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.300
<v Default Subaru>Oh, um, just...

35
00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.480
<v Default Subaru>Emilia-tan...

36
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.270
<v Default Subaru>There's something really 
important I need to tell you.

37
00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.620
<v Default Emilia>Okay. What is it?

38
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.000
<v Default Subaru>This is really hard for me to 
say, but please hear me out.

39
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.640
<v Default Subaru>Oh, and of course, I'm prepared to be 
knocked out by Ram when I tell her!

40
00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.390
<v Default Subaru>But I want you to hear it first.

41
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:42.460
<v Default Emilia>Okay.

42
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.850
<v Default Subaru>It's actually... about Rem.

43
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.940
<v Default Subaru>Rem said that she, um...

44
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.570
<v Default - flashback Rem>You'll still keep me by your side from now on?

45
00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.640
<v Default Subaru>Y-You see what I'm getting at, right?

46
00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.530
<v Default Subaru>I mean, well... Rem said 
some nice things to me...

47
00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.270
<v Default Emilia>Subaru, just calm down for a second.

48
00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:08.650
<v Default Emilia>I'm not sure what you're trying to say,

49
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.920
<v Default Emilia>but I can tell you're trying 
your hardest to say it, okay?

50
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.180
<v Default Emilia>So just take it slow, like a good boy.

51
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.710
<v Default Subaru>"Like a good boy"? That's not
 exactly encouraging.

52
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.620
<v Default Subaru>But... okay.

53
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.180
<v Default Subaru>I'm just gonna come out and say it, like a man!

54
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:26.930
<v Default Subaru>The thing is...

55
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:33.340
<v Default Subaru>Rem said she loves me, the same way 
I told you that I love you! So...

56
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.580
<v Default Emilia>Subaru...

57
00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.160
<v Default Subaru>Yes?

58
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.500
<v Default Emilia>Who...

59
00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.180
<v Default Emilia>is Rem?

60
00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.280
<v Default - flashback Crusch>You don't look very happy, Rem.

61
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.090
<v Default - flashback Crusch>Are you still worried?

62
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.010
<v Default - flashback Rem>Crusch-sama...

63
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.970
<v Default - flashback Crusch>Felis and Wilhelm, and all the volunteers 
fighting alongside us, are the best of the best.

64
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.490
<v Default - flashback Crusch>Ricardo and the Iron Fang are 
lending us their aid, too.

65
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:53.450
<v Default - flashback Crusch>Such an assembly cannot lose.

66
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:58.480
<v Default - flashback Rem>Is it selfish of me to worry despite all that?

67
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.340
<v Default - flashback Crusch>It's as Natsuki Subaru said...

68
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:06.980
<v Default - flashback Crusch>You look best when you're smiling.

69
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:14.290
<v Default - flashback Rem>Honestly...

70
00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:17.330
<v Default - flashback Rem>That Subaru-kun is such a troublemaker.

71
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.440
<v Default - flashback Rem>I'm sure you would also look 
quite different with a smile,

72
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.310
<v Default - flashback Rem>since you always carry 
yourself with such dignity.

73
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.380
<v Default - flashback Rem>I believe you would look lovely if you smiled.

74
00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.850
<v Default - flashback Crusch>Yes, well...

75
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.180
<v Default - flashback Crusch>I'm not very good at smiling.

76
00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:39.440
<v Default - flashback Crusch>It is something I still regret, even now.

77
00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:58.120
<v Default - flashback Crusch>Enemy attack!

78
00:05:58.120 --> 00:05:59.420
<v Default - flashback Crusch>Enemy attack!

79
00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.100
<v Default - flashback Crusch>Run him over!

80
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.430
<v Default - flashback Rem>Crusch-sama!

81
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.690
<v Default - flashback Regulus>I wish you wouldn't do that.

82
00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:31.720
<v Default - flashback Regulus>Ordering them to run me over 
when I'm not doing anything?

83
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.380
<v Default - flashback Regulus>That's not something any 
decent human being would do.

84
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.300
<v Default - flashback Crusch>How dare you do such a brutal 
thing to my retainers?

85
00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:41.710
<v Default - flashback Crusch>Just who are you?

86
00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.220
<v Default - flashback Regulus>I see, I see.

87
00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.100
<v Default - flashback Regulus>You don't know who I am.

88
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.050
<v Default - flashback Regulus>But I know who you are.

89
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.350
<v Default - flashback Regulus>You're a candidate to be the 
next ruler of this nation.

90
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:55.560
<v Default - flashback Crusch>You talk too much.

91
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.020
<v Default - flashback Crusch>Answer my question!

92
00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:59.100
<v Default - flashback Crusch>Next time, I will kill you!

93
00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.860
<v Default - flashback Regulus>Now that's just mean.

94
00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:07.560
<v Default - flashback Regulus>But I suppose one could never hope to rule 
a country without some degree of arrogance.

95
00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.200
<v Default - flashback Regulus>I can't comprehend that 
sensibility myself, but...

96
00:07:09.290 --> 00:07:12.050 line:0
<v Default - flashback Crusch>I told you there would be no second chances!

97
00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:18.340
<v Default - flashback Regulus>Now, look here!

98
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:21.160
<v Default - flashback Regulus>Who taught you that it was acceptable 
to swing a sword at someone

99
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.360
<v Default - flashback >when they're happily talking?

100
00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.880
<v Default - flashback Regulus>I do believe that's a violation 
of my right to speak!

101
00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:32.210
<v Default - flashback Rem>Crusch-sama!

102
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:37.130
<v Default - flashback Crusch>Felis...

103
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:41.100
<v Default - flashback Ley>Ah...

104
00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.240
<v Default - flashback Ley>I keep eating and eating, 
but it's never enough!

105
00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:53.190
<v Default - flashback Ley>I eat, I devour, I chew, I bite, 
I gorge, I gnaw, I munch, I crunch...

106
00:07:53.190 --> 00:07:55.470
<v Default - flashback Ley>Pure gluttony!

107
00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:58.690
<v Default - flashback Ley>Ah, thank you for this feast!

108
00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:04.830
<v Default - flashback Rem>You two are...

109
00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:11.880
<v Default - flashback Ley>Sin Archbishop of the Witch's Cult,
 representing gluttony...

110
00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:14.260
<v Default - flashback Ley>Lye Batenkaitos.

111
00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.850
<v Default - flashback Regulus>And the Sin Archbishop of the 
Witch's Cult, representing greed,

112
00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:21.230
<v Default - flashback Regulus>Regulus Corneas.

113
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.230
<v Default - flashback Ley>We came here because we heard 
our pet had been slain,

114
00:08:25.230 --> 00:08:26.900
<v Default - flashback >and look at this bounty!

115
00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:31.630
<v Default - flashback Ley>I expected them to be a good, ripe bunch, 
considering they managed to kill

116
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:36.490
<v Default - flashback Ley>a beast that had been rampaging 
unchecked for 400 years...

117
00:08:36.490 --> 00:08:39.280
<v Default - flashback Ley>But this is beyond my expectations!

118
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:46.000
<v Default - flashback Ley>Nice! Good! Great! Excellent! Fine! 
Perfect! Fantastic! Stupendous!

119
00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.250
<v Default - flashback Ley>How long it has been since our 
hunger was so thoroughly sated!

120
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:54.090
<v Default - flashback Regulus>You can relax. I'm nothing 
like that guy there.

121
00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:56.500
<v Default - flashback Regulus>I hate fighting and stuff.

122
00:08:56.500 --> 00:08:59.000
<v Default - flashback Regulus>All that "hunger" and "thirst" nonsense?

123
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:02.020
<v Default - flashback Regulus>Such petty self-indulgences are beneath me.

124
00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:08.120
<v Default - flashback Regulus>Were you even listening?

125
00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.700
<v Default - flashback Regulus>Did I not just say that I hate fighting?

126
00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:14.800
<v Default - flashback Rem>Is that all you wish to say,

127
00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:17.360
<v Default - flashback Rem>witch cultist?

128
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:24.900
<v Default - flashback Rem>Soon enough, a hero will appear 
and rid us of all of you.

129
00:09:26.730 --> 00:09:30.250
<v Default - flashback Rem>The one and only hero... whom I love.

130
00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:34.580
<v Default - flashback Ley>Oh? A hero? I look forward to that.

131
00:09:34.580 --> 00:09:36.050
<v Default - flashback Ley>And who are you?

132
00:09:37.170 --> 00:09:41.090
<v Default - flashback Rem>The head maid of the mansion of 
Margrave Roswaal L. Mathers...

133
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:45.730
<v Default - flashback Rem>and currently, the caretaker 
of my one and only love,

134
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:51.610
<v Default - flashback Rem>my beloved Natsuki Subaru, 
who will one day be that hero...

135
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:52.800
<v Default - flashback Rem>Rem!

136
00:09:57.330 --> 00:09:59.660
<v Default - flashback Rem>You'd better be ready, Sin Archbishop!

137
00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.580
<v Default - flashback Rem>I promise you, my hero will soon be here

138
00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:06.530
<v Default - flashback Rem>to bring you to justice!

139
00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.550
<v Default - flashback Ley>Ah, what mettle!

140
00:10:16.910 --> 00:10:19.260
<v Default - flashback Ley>I am most certainly going to enjoy...

141
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:21.820
<v Default - flashback Ley>this feast!

142
00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:49.040
<v Default - flashback Ley>Thank you for the feast.

143
00:11:04.300 --> 00:11:05.200
<v Default Emilia>How awful...

144
00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:07.380
<v Default Subaru>What happened here?

145
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:16.240
<v Default Subaru>Where's Rem?

146
00:11:17.030 --> 00:11:18.500
<v Default Subaru>Where is Rem?!

147
00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:24.870
<v Default - italics Subaru>It's just like before!

148
00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.840
<v Default - flashback Otto>Who is Rem?

149
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:28.500
<v Default - flashback Ram>I have no younger sister.

150
00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.450
<v Default - flashback Emilia>Rem?

151
00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.980
<v Default - italics Subaru>Just like the time when the White Whale got Rem!

152
00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:37.120
<v Default - italics Subaru>But I know we defeated the White Whale!

153
00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.300
<v Default - italics Subaru>So why?!

154
00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:43.180
<v Default Subaru>Rem! Where are you?!

155
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:45.510
<v Default Subaru>If you hear me, say something, Rem!

156
00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:46.660
<v Default Subaru>Rem!

157
00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:49.430
<v Default Subaru>Rem!

158
00:11:52.180 --> 00:11:53.270
<v Default Subaru>Not her...

159
00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:54.480
<v Default Subaru>Rem!

160
00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:55.900
<v Default Subaru>Rem! Rem!

161
00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:57.230
<v Default Subaru>Rem! Rem!

162
00:11:57.440 --> 00:11:58.620
<v Default Subaru>Rem!

163
00:11:59.510 --> 00:12:01.590
<v Default Subaru>Rem! Rem! Rem!

164
00:12:01.590 --> 00:12:03.900
<v Default Subaru>Rem!

165
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:10.780
<v Default Subaru>Rem...

166
00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:15.120
<v Default Subaru>Where did you go, Rem?

167
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:24.670
<v Default Subaru>Rem!

168
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:27.510
<v Default Subaru>Come on, Rem, wake up! It's me!

169
00:12:28.390 --> 00:12:29.810
<v Default Subaru>Hey, Rem?

170
00:12:29.810 --> 00:12:31.350
<v Default Subaru>Rem... Rem!

171
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:33.330
<v Default Doc>You know this girl?

172
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:34.890
<v Default Subaru>Yes! She's Rem!

173
00:12:34.890 --> 00:12:37.360
<v Default Subaru>She's alive, right?! Why won't she wake up?!

174
00:12:37.730 --> 00:12:40.490
<v Default Healer>Unfortunately, she's beyond help.

175
00:12:40.960 --> 00:12:42.570
<v Default Healer>Nothing I can do will wake her—

176
00:12:42.570 --> 00:12:45.420
<v Default Subaru>Why?! And you call yourself a healer?!

177
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:47.210
<v Default Subaru>If you're a healer, then heal her!

178
00:12:47.210 --> 00:12:49.840
<v Default Subaru>Wake her up with magic! Right now!

179
00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.100
<v Default Subaru>Come on!

180
00:12:52.620 --> 00:12:53.930
<v Default Subaru>Please...

181
00:12:55.870 --> 00:12:56.970
<v Default Subaru>Come on...

182
00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.400
<v Default Subaru>If I Return by Death now...

183
00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:29.570
<v Default Subaru>I'll have to fight Petelgeuse again.

184
00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:33.620
<v Default Subaru>But I don't care.

185
00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:36.740
<v Default Subaru>I'll fight him as many times as it takes...

186
00:13:36.740 --> 00:13:38.260
<v Default Subaru>beat him as many times as it takes...

187
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:42.220
<v Default Subaru>to save both Emilia and Rem.

188
00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:44.510
<v Default Subaru>I won't let either of them die!

189
00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:48.930
<v Default Subaru>If it'll save both of you...

190
00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:50.440
<v Default >I'll...

191
00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:53.320
<v Default Subaru>As many times as it takes!

192
00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:58.400
<v Default Emilia>Are you all right?

193
00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:00.150
<v Default Emilia>Subaru, what's the matter?

194
00:14:04.030 --> 00:14:04.820
<v Default Subaru>Where's Rem?

195
00:14:05.610 --> 00:14:07.110
<v Default Subaru>What happened to Rem?

196
00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:11.800
<v Default Emilia>Subaru...

197
00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:14.980
<v Default Emilia>Who...

198
00:14:17.940 --> 00:14:19.040
<v Default Emilia>is Rem?

199
00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:29.820
<v Default Subaru>Now that I think about it,

200
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:33.050
<v Default Subaru>I never really saw you sleeping before.

201
00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:37.270
<v Default Subaru>You always woke up before me.

202
00:14:37.530 --> 00:14:39.000
<v Default Subaru>Before I realized it,

203
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.440
<v Default >you were already in my room,
 watching me sleep.

204
00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.260
<v Default Subaru>Rem...

205
00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:47.990
<v Default Subaru>I'm sorry, Rem.

206
00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:50.960
<v Default Subaru>I tried to sound all brave,

207
00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.520
<v Default Subaru>saying I'd die as many times as 
it would take to save you...

208
00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:57.170
<v Default Subaru>But I guess no matter how many times I die,

209
00:14:57.170 --> 00:14:58.820
<v Default Subaru>I'll never make it in time.

210
00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:08.290
<v Default Subaru>Oh, it's just you, Puck.

211
00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:10.490
<v Default Puck>"Just" me? I don't think that was necessary.

212
00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:11.950
<v Default Puck>You're so mean.

213
00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:15.600
<v Default Subaru>So what brings you all the way out here?

214
00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:18.880
<v Default Puck>I have a connection with 
this girl too, remember?

215
00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:22.560
<v Default Puck>So what's wrong with me dropping 
by to check in on her?

216
00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:24.960
<v Default Subaru>Puck, couldn't you—

217
00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:30.840
<v Default Puck>Sorry, but not even my power can 
wake her from the sleep she's in.

218
00:15:33.390 --> 00:15:36.410
<v Default Puck>It might not do much to make up for that,

219
00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:39.560
<v Default Puck>but I could tell you a bit about Gluttony.

220
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:40.540
<v Default Subaru>Gluttony?

221
00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:45.000
<v Default Puck>The one who devoured her name and memories.

222
00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.240
<v Default Puck>Put simply, the Authority of Gluttony

223
00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:52.200
<v Default Puck>is a power for eating.

224
00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:55.250
<v Default Puck>He can eat someone's name and 
make everyone forget about them,

225
00:15:55.250 --> 00:15:58.880
<v Default Puck>or make that person lose their 
own memories by eating them.

226
00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:00.600
<v Default Puck>If both your name and your memories are taken,

227
00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:05.210
<v Default Puck>there'll be nothing left 
of you but an empty shell.

228
00:16:05.210 --> 00:16:08.330
<v Default Puck>That's what happened to this girl.

229
00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:10.870
<v Default Puck>Subaru...

230
00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:12.380
<v Default Subaru>What?!

231
00:16:12.380 --> 00:16:16.480
<v Default Puck>I hate to ask a favor of you when you've 
already got so much on your mind...

232
00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:22.440
<v Default Puck>But I'm counting on you to take care of Lia.

233
00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.300
<v Default Crusch>So this is where you were.

234
00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:34.300
<v Default Crusch>How is she?

235
00:16:34.920 --> 00:16:37.200
<v Default Subaru>No changes at all.

236
00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.560
<v Default Subaru>It's not as if there's anything I can even do...

237
00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:43.020
<v Default Subaru>I know I'm weak and pathetic, and yet...

238
00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.010
<v Default Crusch>That's not true at all.

239
00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:48.900
<v Default Crusch>I believe you made her quite happy, in fact.

240
00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.820
<v Default Crusch>I'm sorry... That was crossing a line.

241
00:16:54.190 --> 00:16:56.090
<v Default Crusch>I've made you upset, haven't I?

242
00:16:56.090 --> 00:16:56.880
<v Default Subaru>No.

243
00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:00.620
<v Default Subaru>Anyway, were you looking for me 
because you needed something?

244
00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:05.960
<v Default Crusch>Yes. Everyone has gathered in 
the lounge to discuss things.

245
00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:08.220
<v Default Crusch>And, well... um...

246
00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:15.550
<v Default Subaru>It's Natsuki Subaru.

247
00:17:15.550 --> 00:17:18.860
<v Default Crusch>I'm sorry. Of course, 
you're Natsuki Subaru-sama.

248
00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:21.250
<v Default Crusch>I've been told that I owe you a great deal,

249
00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:23.810
<v Default Crusch>and yet I've been nothing but rude.
 Please forgive me.

250
00:17:23.810 --> 00:17:25.980
<v Default Subaru>Nah, you can't help it.

251
00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:29.060
<v Default Subaru>I know you have a lot to remember right now.

252
00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.980
<v Default Subaru>It doesn't bother me, Crusch-san.

253
00:17:33.730 --> 00:17:36.850
<v Default Felis>Crusch-sama, I'm sorry for making 
you deliver that message.

254
00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:39.530
<v Default Crusch>No, it's quite all right, Felis-san.

255
00:17:39.530 --> 00:17:41.240
<v Default Felis>It's just "Felis."

256
00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:44.300
<v Default Felis>You and I have known each other for ages.

257
00:17:44.300 --> 00:17:47.990
<v Default Felis>It makes me sad when you talk 
to me like you don't know me.

258
00:17:47.990 --> 00:17:49.200
<v Default Crusch>I'm sorry.

259
00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:54.880
<v Default Crusch>I know it won't be like before, 
but I'll try my best, Felis.

260
00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:57.800
<v Default Felis>There's no need to rush.

261
00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:01.360
<v Default Felis>I'll always be on your side, Crusch-sama!

262
00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:05.770
<v Default Felis>Besides, it's like I'm seeing 
a whole new side to you now!

263
00:18:07.670 --> 00:18:08.460
<v Default Emilia>Subaru?

264
00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:12.660
<v Default Subaru>It's okay. I've calmed down now, Emilia-tan.

265
00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:14.150
<v Default Subaru>I'm just fine.

266
00:18:14.550 --> 00:18:18.540
<v Default Wilhelm>Well, now that Subaru-dono and 
Crusch-sama have returned,

267
00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.120
<v Default Wilhelm>let us talk.

268
00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:24.040
<v Default Felis>Let's start by reviewing 
where we currently stand.

269
00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.410
<v Default Felis>By the time the Iron Fang 
members who got away

270
00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:29.030
<v Default Felis>brought back reinforcements 
from the capital,

271
00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:31.590
<v Default Felis>the only ones left were the casualties and...

272
00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:35.510
<v Default Crusch>...those in situations similar to mine.

273
00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.830
<v Default Subaru>Crusch-san's memories were eaten,

274
00:18:38.830 --> 00:18:42.760
<v Default Subaru>and Rem lost both her name and her memories...

275
00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:44.530
<v Default Felis>The capital has also had many cases

276
00:18:44.530 --> 00:18:48.920
<v Default Felis>of memory loss that no healer 
could fix, like Crusch-sama,

277
00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:53.270
<v Default Felis>and an unexplained malady they've 
dubbed the "Sleeping Beauty disease."

278
00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:56.860
<v Default Felis>But now, all of that...

279
00:18:58.090 --> 00:19:01.610
<v Default Wilhelm>...should be considered the 
work of the Witch's Cult.

280
00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.820
<v Default Wilhelm>Oh, I meant nothing against you, Crusch-sama.

281
00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:10.390
<v Default Wilhelm>I do apologize for frightening you.

282
00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:14.170
<v Default Crusch>No, I apologize for being 
such a hopeless master.

283
00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:18.750
<v Default Crusch>I've been trying my hardest to 
remember you, as well, but...

284
00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.560
<v Default Felis>We finally took care of Sloth,

285
00:19:23.560 --> 00:19:27.700
<v Default Felis>and now there's another 
Sin Archbishop? This really sucks.

286
00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:31.130
<v Default Felis>Of course, the moment Emilia-sama became 
a candidate in the royal selection,

287
00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:33.860
<v Default Felis>we knew the Witch's Cult would get involved.

288
00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.170
<v Default Emilia>Maybe... it really is my fault.

289
00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.210
<v Default Felis>Well, that's true.

290
00:19:40.210 --> 00:19:44.950
<v Default Felis>They're fixated on getting rid 
of Emilia-sama, the half-elf.

291
00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.930
<v Default Felis>What's going on now is just a tiny part of—

292
00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:49.370
<v Default Subaru>Cut it out! That's ridiculous!

293
00:19:49.370 --> 00:19:51.420
<v Default Subaru>Give a little more thought to what you say!

294
00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:54.660
<v Default Subaru>The only ones at fault here are those scumbags!

295
00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:57.130
<v Default Subaru>Don't put all the blame on the wrong person!

296
00:19:57.130 --> 00:19:59.920
<v Default Subaru>Hurting your own allies with 
misdirected blame isn't gonna help!

297
00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:04.240
<v Default Felis>Hmm? Coming from you, Subaru-kyun, 
that's so much more convincing.

298
00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.440
<v Default Felis>I guess it's the difference in experience?

299
00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:07.360
<v Default Crusch>Felis.

300
00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.330
<v Default Crusch>I cannot ignore the comment you just made.

301
00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:12.580
<v Default Crusch>Apologize.

302
00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.680
<v Default Crusch>Natsuki Subaru-sama is right.

303
00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:20.520
<v Default Crusch>It is crystal clear where 
the blame should fall.

304
00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:25.050
<v Default Crusch>Plus, you do not have the 
right to ridicule someone

305
00:20:25.050 --> 00:20:26.420
<v Default >who has made a correct statement.

306
00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:30.120
<v Default Felis>Yes, Crusch-sama.

307
00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:34.190
<v Default Felis>Emilia-sama, I apologize.

308
00:20:34.190 --> 00:20:36.210
<v Default Felis>To you, too, Subaru-kyun.

309
00:20:36.660 --> 00:20:39.780
<v Default Subaru>Forget it. Let's just get back on topic.

310
00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:42.250
<v Default Felis>But just let me say this.

311
00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.050
<v Default Felis>About the alliance we spoke of...

312
00:20:50.630 --> 00:20:52.430
<v Default Felis>Can we just scrap that idea?

313
00:20:54.650 --> 00:20:57.640
<v Default Subaru>What do you mean by that?

314
00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:00.800
<v Default Subaru>How did all this lead to the subject 
of dissolving the alliance?

315
00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:05.320
<v Default Felis>An alliance is formed when it 
benefits all parties involved.

316
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:09.410
<v Default Felis>You expect us to ally ourselves 
with Emilia-sama, the Witch Cult's target?

317
00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:14.660
<v Default Felis>Can you promise that Crusch-sama 
won't be hurt again if we do that?

318
00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:17.830
<v Default Subaru>Well...

319
00:21:18.650 --> 00:21:21.670
<v Default Wilhelm>I am opposed to that opinion.

320
00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:24.200
<v Default Felis>Why would you be opposed, Old Man Wil?!

321
00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:26.470
<v Default Felis>Look what's happened to Crusch-sama!

322
00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:30.420
<v Default Felis>What point is there in continuing to 
assist Emilia-sama and her friends?!

323
00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:35.400
<v Default Wilhelm>With regard to this "Gluttony," 
the one who attacked Crusch-sama...

324
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.770
<v Default Wilhelm>We may be given an opportunity for revenge.

325
00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:41.370
<v Default Felis>Is that more important than Crusch-sama's life?!

326
00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:42.410
<v Default Crusch>Felis...

327
00:21:42.410 --> 00:21:44.620
<v Default Felis>I know this is hard on Crusch-sama, too!

328
00:21:45.260 --> 00:21:48.610
<v Default Felis>She has no idea what's going on, 
she can't remember anything...

329
00:21:48.610 --> 00:21:51.140
<v Default Felis>So how can you expect her to fight?!

330
00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:53.380
<v Default Felis>Isn't that right? Isn't it?!

331
00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:57.750
<v Default Felis>I'm sure I can do something 
about your memories!

332
00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:02.130
<v Default Felis>Even if it's not enough right now, 
I'll fix this with my magic!

333
00:22:02.130 --> 00:22:04.840
<v Default Felis>So please don't put yourself 
in any more danger!

334
00:22:10.130 --> 00:22:13.140
<v Default Crusch>Felis, thank you for worrying about me.

335
00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:18.450
<v Default Crusch>Right now, there is simply 
too much I don't understand.

336
00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:23.000
<v Default Crusch>I can't remember a single detail 
about who I used to be.

337
00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:28.610
<v Default Crusch>I'm sure all of you are perplexed as to 
how you should interact with me, too.

338
00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:33.350
<v Default Crusch>But to everyone who still retains their 
respect for me despite all this,

339
00:22:33.350 --> 00:22:34.830
<v Default Crusch>I must express my thanks.

340
00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:41.480
<v Default Crusch>Felis, I know that your 
concern for me is genuine,

341
00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.590
<v Default Crusch>and that you are trying to guide me.

342
00:22:45.090 --> 00:22:49.480
<v Default Crusch>I could do as you say and walk 
the path that is safest.

343
00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:54.480
<v Default Crusch>But I loathe the thought of going 
on with my life, knowing nothing.

344
00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.940
<v Default Crusch>If I have a choice, I would 
rather choose for myself

345
00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.320
<v Default Crusch>than simply do as someone says.

346
00:23:10.450 --> 00:23:12.150
<v Default Felis>Crusch-sama...

347
00:23:20.610 --> 00:23:21.500
<v Default Crusch>Felis...

348
00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:37.880
<v Default Wilhelm>If this is Crusch-sama's will,

349
00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:40.560
<v Default Wilhelm>surely no one would be in favor 
of dissolving the alliance.

350
00:23:41.090 --> 00:23:42.060
<v Default Crusch>Right.

351
00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:46.770
<v Default Crusch>I know I will be a great deal of trouble to 
you, Emilia-sama and Natsuki Subaru-sama.

352
00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:49.260
<v Default Emilia>No, it's all right.

353
00:23:49.670 --> 00:23:52.980
<v Default Emilia>We can't exactly say we're all 
on the same page, either.

354
00:23:53.590 --> 00:23:56.440
<v Default Emilia>We need to rejoin Ram and everyone
else who's at the Sanctuary,

355
00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:59.520
<v Default Emilia>and we need to talk it over with Roswaal, too.

356
00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:14.360
<v Default Subaru>You said I was strong,

357
00:24:15.030 --> 00:24:16.470
<v Default Subaru>but without you,

358
00:24:17.200 --> 00:24:22.130
<v Default Subaru>I can't even find the Subaru who 
could put on that tough guy act, Rem.

359
00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:25.160
<v Default Emilia>I knew you'd be here.

360
00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:29.530
<v Default Subaru>Oh... Emilia.

361
00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:31.940
<v Default Subaru>Did you need something?

362
00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:34.950
<v Default Emilia>Am I not allowed to be here if I don't?

363
00:24:35.930 --> 00:24:39.990
<v Default Emilia>I know this girl... Rem-san, too, don't I?

364
00:24:40.570 --> 00:24:42.860
<v Default Subaru>"Rem-san," huh?

365
00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:44.450
<v Default Emilia>Oh, right...

366
00:24:45.280 --> 00:24:48.670
<v Default >I just called her "Rem" before.

367
00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.940
<v Default Subaru>Well, you're basically Roswaal's guest.

368
00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:55.680
<v Default Subaru>I don't need to explain that 
she's Ram's sister, right?

369
00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:57.630
<v Default Emilia>Yes, I can tell.

370
00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:00.030
<v Default Emilia>She looks just like her.

371
00:25:00.030 --> 00:25:02.140
<v Default Emilia>There's no mistaking that.

372
00:25:02.950 --> 00:25:05.670
<v Default Emilia>Subaru, you haven't slept at all, have you?

373
00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:08.150
<v Default Emilia>You should rest for a while.

374
00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:12.150
<v Default Subaru>It's not like I'm doing anything 
that'd make me tired.

375
00:25:13.010 --> 00:25:14.740
<v Default Subaru>It's not like I <i>can</i> do anything.

376
00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:18.300
<v Default Emilia>But it's true that you want 
to do something, right?

377
00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.580
<v Default Emilia>If your spirit keeps trying 
so hard for so long,

378
00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:24.360
<v Default Emilia>your body will wear out first.

379
00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:26.230
<v Default Emilia>So... please.

380
00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:31.430
<v Default Subaru>I'm so pathetic.

381
00:25:31.830 --> 00:25:33.840
<v Default Emilia>No, you're not.

382
00:25:34.220 --> 00:25:37.500
<v Default Emilia>You've helped me so much, Subaru.

383
00:25:38.230 --> 00:25:39.520
<v Default Emilia>I really mean it.

384
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:42.280
<v Default Emilia>It'll all be fine...

385
00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.300
<v Default Emilia>Not that I have any right 
to talk as if I know that.

386
00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:50.190
<v Default Emilia>I want to understand how you feel,

387
00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:55.520
<v Default Emilia>but since I don't remember 
anything about this girl,

388
00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:58.120
<v Default Emilia>I know anything I say will just hurt you.

389
00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:02.890
<v Default Emilia>But...

390
00:26:03.540 --> 00:26:05.620
<v Default Emilia>Just know this, please.

391
00:26:06.510 --> 00:26:10.950
<v Default Emilia>Don't burden yourself with carrying 
the weight of Rem alone.

392
00:26:10.950 --> 00:26:15.030
<v Default Emilia>Let me carry your burdens with you.

393
00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:17.100
<v Default Subaru>Emilia...

394
00:26:18.370 --> 00:26:22.050
<v Default Subaru>But you don't even remember 
anything about Rem.

395
00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:26.620
<v Default Emilia>Is it wrong to want to do something 
if I don't remember her?

396
00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:31.510
<v Default Emilia>She's important enough to you that 
it's made you this sad, right?

397
00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:37.010
<v Default Emilia>Is it so strange that it makes 
me want to help her, too?

398
00:26:38.450 --> 00:26:40.530
<v Default Emilia>Just like you saved me,

399
00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:43.720
<v Default Emilia>I want to save you this time.

400
00:26:43.720 --> 00:26:47.230
<v Default Emilia>If you're in pain, I want 
to do something for you.

401
00:26:59.370 --> 00:27:01.770
<v Default Subaru>You're amazing, Emilia-tan.

402
00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:06.260
<v Default Emilia>Really? I think you're much 
more amazing than me.

403
00:27:06.760 --> 00:27:09.300
<v Default Subaru>No, I'm really not.

404
00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.710
<v Default Subaru>I'm glad it was you.

405
00:27:18.100 --> 00:27:21.680
<v Default Subaru>Emilia... I have a favor to ask.

406
00:27:22.650 --> 00:27:23.450
<v Default Emilia>What is it?

407
00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:26.500
<v Default Subaru>Could you turn around?

408
00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:28.660
<v Default Subaru>I'm going to cry.

409
00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:31.860
<v Default Emilia>All right.

410
00:28:18.990 --> 00:28:20.610
<v Default Subaru>I swear...

411
00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:22.970
<v Default >I will get you back.

412
00:28:23.740 --> 00:28:24.960
<v Default Subaru>I swear it.

413
00:28:26.060 --> 00:28:28.000
<v Default Subaru>I'm going to...

414
00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:31.190
<v Default Subaru>Your hero is going to come for you!

415
00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:33.630
<v Default Subaru>I swear it!

416
00:28:35.580 --> 00:28:36.580
<v Default Subaru>Just wait for me,

417
00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:40.030
<v Episode Title Title>Each One's Promise

418
00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:38.610
<v Default >Rem.
