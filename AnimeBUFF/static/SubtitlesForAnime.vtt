36
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.660
<v Dialogue etc >An excellent leader needs an excellent council.

37
00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:41.360
<v Dialogue etc >And the fact that I didn't have a capable No. 2 until now

38
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.620
<v Dialogue etc >is also the reason our school has been stagnant.

39
00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.620
<v Dialogue etc >It can also be said that it's because there was
no one who met my standards for the job.

40
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.460
<v Dialogue etc >But I finally found the man
who's suitable to be No. 2!

41
00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.140
<v Dialogue etc >Since Yamaguchi accepted this guy,

42
00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.380
<v Dialogue etc >that probably means he's no ordinary man.

43
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.580
<v Dialogue etc >What the hell is he like?

44
00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.110
<v Dialogue etc >Well, don't get rattled.
He's actually here right now.

45
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.690

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.150
<v Dialogue etc >I'm Mick. Nice to meet you all.

50
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.990
<v Dialogue etc >He's No. 2 from now on.

51
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.360
<v Dialogue etc >So, nice to meet you.

52
00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.640
<v Dialogue etc >I'll knock you guys
 down with a single blow.

53
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.180
<v Dialogue etc >Don't be rude.

54
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.300
<v Dialogue etc >Shut up, idiot.

55
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.880
<v Dialogue etc >Well, it'd be good
 if you work on your timing a little.

56
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.880
<v Dialogue etc >Hey, hold on a second!

57
00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.750
<v Dialogue etc >We didn't call a ventriloquist!

58
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.090
<v Dialogue etc >Ishikawa's jaw is dislocated.

59
00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.660
<v Dialogue etc >Don't say something like "ventriloquist"!

60
00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.700
<v Dialogue etc >Why you gotta say things
 that destroy people's dreams, moron?!

61
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.530
<v Dialogue etc >For example, when Americans see magic,

62
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.710
<v Dialogue etc >they enjoy it purely as entertainment
even if they know it's a trick.

63
00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.340
<v Dialogue etc >But when the Japanese see it,

64
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.740
<v Dialogue etc >they immediately try to uncover
the tricks and gimmicks.

65
00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.610
<v Dialogue etc >You can say the same thing about pro wrestling.

66
00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.620
<v Dialogue etc >Even if it's staged, have a mind that
enjoys it purely as entertainment!

67
00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.420
<v Dialogue etc >Entertainment?

68
00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.520
<v Dialogue etc >What do you want from us?

69
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.590
<v Dialogue etc >Hey, Yamaguchi, I don't 
mean to tease or stir things up,

70
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.060
<v Dialogue etc >but can I ask you one question?

71
00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.380
<v Dialogue etc >Yeah, go ahead.

72
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.830
<v Dialogue etc >Which one is No. 2?

73
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.270
<v Dialogue etc >I see! Even I hadn't thought of that!

74
00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.240
<v Dialogue etc >Then I'll ask. Which one is No. 2?

75
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.680
<v Dialogue etc >You don't have to ask him, do you?

76
00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.750
<v Dialogue etc >Mick, we've been together for a long time,

77
00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.050
<v Dialogue etc >but it looks like only one of us
can become No. 2.

78
00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:44.720
<v Dialogue etc >Shut it! Of course I'm No. 2!

79
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.090
<v Dialogue etc >You've gotten rude.

80
00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.860
<v Dialogue etc >Then how about this? 
One of you is "No." and the other is "2".

81
00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.100
<v Dialogue etc >So put together you're No. 2.

82
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.700
<v Dialogue etc >Oh, I'll use that one.

83
00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.500
<v Dialogue etc >The joke's a little old, though.

84
00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.760
<v Dialogue etc >Then what about me?

85
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.640
<v Dialogue etc >You guys are a trio?!

86
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.140
<v Dialogue etc >Stay out of this!

87
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.220
<v Dialogue etc >This reminds me of Tokyo Comic Show.

88
00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:07.890
<v Dialogue etc >Yamaguchi, can I talk to you?

89
00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:09.980
<v Dialogue etc >It doesn't really matter,

90
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:14.220
<v Dialogue etc >but I imagine he's 
powerful enough to be No. 2, right?

91
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.400
<v Dialogue etc >Otherwise, we won't accept it.

92
00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:21.090
<v Dialogue etc >Looks like you don't know
his real power yet, do you?

93
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.430
<v Dialogue etc >He's not just a variety guy.

94
00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.060
<v Dialogue etc >Show them what you can do!

95
00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.190
<v Dialogue etc >Okay!

96
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:31.230
<v Dialogue etc >He took the puppets off.

97
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:32.830
<v Dialogue etc >Is he really no ordinary guy after all?!

98
00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.330
<v Dialogue etc >Oh? My voice is...

99
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.740
<v Dialogue etc >Coming out...

100
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:44.570
<v Dialogue etc >Delayed?

101
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.620
<v Dialogue etc >How about that?! Just like
satellite coverage, right?! Well?!

102
00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:52.750
<v Dialogue etc >I've seen this somewhere.

103
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.760
<v Dialogue etc >To say the least, 
this doesn't help in fighting at all.

104
00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:01.560
<v Dialogue etc >In any case, he's No. 2 from today.
Take his words as mine.

105
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.470
<v Dialogue etc >So which one is it?!

106
00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:06.060
<v Dialogue etc >I'm so confused now!

107
00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:09.360
<v Dialogue etc >What a pain in the ass! 
It doesn't matter which, come and fight me!

108
00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.460
<v Dialogue etc >This means...

109
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:17.150
<v Dialogue etc >He's No. 2.

110
00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.580
<v Dialogue etc >Yeah, leave it to me!

111
00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:19.880
<v Dialogue etc >Looks like he's serious.

112
00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:31.810
<v Typeset >Yutaka Takenouchi (16)

113
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:27.320
<v Dialogue etc >My name is Yutaka Takenouchi.

114
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.830
<v Dialogue etc >I'm very strong in fighting 
and I command Year 1 at Cromartie as their boss.

115
00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:38.020
<v Dialogue etc >But my only weak point is that I get
carsickness easily, so I don't like vehicles!

116
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.000
<v Dialogue etc >Although I look like this,
I'm actually smart too.

117
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.040
<v Dialogue etc >In middle school my deviation value was
easily over 60, even when I didn't study.

118
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.510
<v Dialogue etc >The reason why someone like me entered into
a stupid school like Cromartie High School is

119
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.450
<v Typeset >My home

120
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.450
<v Typeset >Cromartie
 High School

121
00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.050
<v Dialogue etc >because Cromartie High School is
the closest school to my house.

122
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.750
<v Dialogue etc >This is very important to someone
who gets motion sickness.

123
00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:01.090
<v Dialogue etc >But it takes at least fifteen minutes on foot to get
to school, even though I said it was the closest.

124
00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.730
<v Dialogue etc >So I feel too lazy to keep doing it every day.

125
00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:06.670
<v Dialogue etc >But then, I'd look funny riding wheels.

126
00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:06.690
<v Typeset >Wheels - a bicycle

127
00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:07.500
<v Dialogue etc >But then, I'd look funny riding wheels.

128
00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.900
<v Dialogue etc >At first, just watching the bus made me nervous,

129
00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.890
<v Dialogue etc >but I think I can bear it if it's only two stops.

130
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.040
<v Dialogue etc >And that annoying guy isn't around here, so...

131
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.400
<v Dialogue etc >Oh? Takenouchi?

132
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:20.310
<v Typeset >That annoying guy (16)

133
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.640
<v Dialogue etc >No way!

134
00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:24.450
<v Dialogue etc >You! Why are you on the bus?
Tell me the reason! What's the reason?!

135
00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:26.380
<v Dialogue etc >Well, even if you ask me the reason...

136
00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:29.910
<v Dialogue etc >Is your house far from school?!
Spit it out, bastard!

137
00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.220
<v Dialogue etc >It takes ten minutes on foot
from my house to school,

138
00:06:33.220 --> 00:06:34.790
<v Dialogue etc >and about three minutes if I use wheels.

139
00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:38.280
<v Dialogue etc >That's closer than my house!
Why are you on the bus?

140
00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:40.200
<v Dialogue etc >To tell you the truth, I...

141
00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.920
<v Dialogue etc >love transportation!

142
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.300
<v Dialogue etc >The reason I asked you
 to gather today is none other than

143
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.550
<v Typeset >m 0 0 l 108 0 108 85 0 85

00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:52.550
<v Typeset >Destrade
Emergency
Board
Meeting

145
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.570
<v Dialogue etc >to talk about Des-High's course
of action in the future.

146
00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:56.380
<v Dialogue etc >Lately at Des-High,
 I hear many people saying

147
00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:59.400
<v Dialogue etc >that we should be more aggressive
with other schools.

148
00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:05.090
<v Dialogue etc >But this is a very important matter
and I can't decide it by myself.

149
00:07:05.090 --> 00:07:08.450
<v Dialogue etc >So I'd like to do this democratically
and decide by majority vote.

150
00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:11.030
<v Dialogue etc >Then I'll tell you my opinion.

151
00:07:11.030 --> 00:07:13.560
<v Dialogue etc >I usually don't say serious things,

152
00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:15.860
<v Dialogue etc >but I'll duly tell you my opinion here.

153
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.530
<v Dialogue etc >Right now, the situation is unstable
due to the big change

154
00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:21.570
<v Dialogue etc >in the balance of power between schools.

155
00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:25.640
<v Dialogue etc >I don't think it's a good idea to
be aggressive in that kind of time.

156
00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.580
<v Dialogue etc >So I cast a vote for "against."

157
00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.780
<v Dialogue etc >I see. I understand fully.
Well, any other opinions?

158
00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:34.380
<v Dialogue etc >I'm for it.

159
00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:35.650
<v Dialogue etc >Me too.

160
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:38.650
<v Dialogue etc >Okay, then, we're for it with two to one votes.

161
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:39.920
<v Dialogue etc >Hold on a second!

162
00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.890
<v Dialogue etc >What? Do you have an objection?

163
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:43.760
<v Dialogue etc >No... Well...

164
00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.160
<v Dialogue etc >Of course you're not gonna say something like

165
00:07:45.160 --> 00:07:49.860
<v Dialogue etc >"this is ventriloquism
 and one of them is a puppet," are you?

166
00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:57.370
<v Dialogue etc >Then, if Toshiyuki Nishida is playing the role
of Genta Ikenaka when you're watching TV,

167
00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:02.080
<v Dialogue etc >are you gonna shout and scream, saying "He's
not Genta Ikenaka, but Toshiyuki Nishida"?

168
00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.980
<v Dialogue etc >Well, I wouldn't do such a thing,
although that's a confusing example.

169
00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:09.750
<v Dialogue etc >I see you've grown. Then
what kind of objection is it?

170
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.190
<v Dialogue etc >Well...

171
00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:14.660
<v Dialogue etc >Well, his hair style has been bugging me.

172
00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:15.460
<v Dialogue etc >What?!

173
00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:17.490
<v Dialogue etc >Come to think of it, it bothers me too.

174
00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:19.460
<v Dialogue etc >What? You too?!

175
00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:23.100
<v Dialogue etc >You should be completely open with each other.

176
00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.770
<v Dialogue etc >That's what democratic debate is about.

177
00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:28.740
<v Dialogue etc >That's just what I want.
 I won't lose in a name-calling match.

178
00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:29.960
<v Dialogue etc >What did you say?

179
00:08:30.340 --> 00:08:31.700
<v Dialogue etc >lt's getting exciting!

180
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:33.230
<v Dialogue etc >That's enough!

181
00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.880
<v Dialogue etc >What's the matter, Ishikawa?
Join the debate too.

182
00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:38.910
<v Dialogue etc >Shut up! I'm going home!

183
00:08:46.450 --> 00:08:50.300
<v Dialogue etc >Dammit! He always favors that guy.

184
00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:53.860
<v Dialogue etc >Whenever something happens,
I'm the only one that gets beaten up,

185
00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:55.930
<v Dialogue etc >and I don't even know the reason.

186
00:08:55.930 --> 00:09:01.700
<v Dialogue etc >Well, I have sort of noticed that Yamaguchi's
sense of humor and mine don't match, but...

187
00:09:02.810 --> 00:09:06.140
<v Dialogue etc >I've been doing fine on my own,

188
00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:11.310
<v Dialogue etc >but I guess even a delinquent may need a spirit
of cooperation to work well with others.

189
00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:18.790
<v Dialogue etc >I wonder if ventriloquism
is the only way, after all?

190
00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:21.250
<v Dialogue etc >What? You wanna do ventriloquism?!

191
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.190
<v Dialogue etc >Who're you?!

192
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:26.830
<v Dialogue etc >I'm Paul. I'll introduce my master to you.

193
00:09:26.830 --> 00:09:28.300
<v Dialogue etc >Your master?

194
00:09:28.660 --> 00:09:31.600
<v Dialogue etc >How do you do? I'm Kamiyama.

195
00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.380
<v Dialogue etc >I'm Paul. Nice to meet you.

196
00:09:35.070 --> 00:09:36.370
<v Dialogue etc >Oh? My voice is...

197
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:39.310
<v Dialogue etc >Coming out delayed.

198
00:09:39.310 --> 00:09:42.540
<v Dialogue etc >That technique?!
 How are you able to do it?!

199
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.890
<v Dialogue etc >So it wasn't a technique that only he could do!

200
00:09:46.150 --> 00:09:47.840
<v Dialogue etc >What the heck are you mumbling about?

201
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:50.610
<v Dialogue etc >Please! Please make me your pupil!

202
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.090
<v Dialogue etc >All right. Then let's go and
buy you one straightaway.

203
00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.590
<v Dialogue etc >Buy what?

204
00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:57.520
<v Typeset >Next day

205
00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:03.030
<v Dialogue etc >How do you do? I'm David.

206
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:05.570
<v Dialogue etc >He's my new partner.
 He's looking forward to getting to know you.

207
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:09.140
<v Dialogue etc >Fighting's okay,
 and feel the sorrow well... just kidding.

208
00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:11.250
<v Dialogue etc >Now I think better of you, Ishikawa!

209
00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:14.280
<v Dialogue etc >So you finally understand, Yamaguchi!

210
00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:16.080
<v Dialogue etc >It was worth spending 150,000 yen.

211
00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:18.380
<v Dialogue etc >Yeah, you win.

212
00:10:18.380 --> 00:10:21.550
<v Dialogue etc >What I wanted was that spirit of yours!

213
00:10:21.550 --> 00:10:25.180
<v Dialogue etc >This means that I have to rethink
the ranking of our group.

214
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:28.270
<v Dialogue etc >What? Then...

215
00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:31.050
<v Dialogue etc >Listen carefully! I have
an announcement to make to you.

216
00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:35.530
<v Dialogue etc >He is the new No. 2 from today.

217
00:10:35.530 --> 00:10:36.530
<v Dialogue etc >Looking forward to getting to know you!

218
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:38.730
<v Dialogue etc >I have a feeling that we can get along.

219
00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:44.070
<v Dialogue etc >How much does he think it cost?

220
00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:45.380
<v Typeset >Next

even if there are four!

224
00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.020
<v Dialogue etc >Dear Mother,

225
00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:38.660
<v Dialogue etc >Sakigake!! Cromartie High School.

226
00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:41.160
<v Dialogue etc >I'm beginning to think that
I'd be better off if I say

227
00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.260
<v Dialogue etc >"I'll tell you about the next episode."

228
00:11:43.260 --> 00:11:45.070
<v Dialogue etc >Okay, I'll try my best to do it as I've been doing.
